        Vietnam has still a way to go before being a world-renowned
      destination. However, it still has its share of activities.
      These range from stunning Ha Long Bay to beautifully quaint
      Hoi An to Ho Chi Minh’s mausoleum.
      The Cu Chi tunnels represent the sheer grit and ‘can-do’ attitude of the Vietnamese while a visit to the War Remnants
      Museum brings home the horrible reality of war.
